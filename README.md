Pokimon-Card 🃏

A web app that displays Pokémon-style cards (or “Pokimon cards”) with images and details.
The project randomly selects or fetches images, shows dynamic cards, and offers interactive behavior.

⚙️ Features

Displays a card or a set of cards with Pokémon-like visuals

Random selection or dynamic generation of card images

Interactive behavior (e.g. hover, click to change, etc.)

Responsive layout (works on desktop and mobile)

Easily extensible — add more card data, interactivity, or animations

📁 Project Structure

Here’s a typical file structure (adjust as per your setup):

Pokimon-card/
│
├── index.html            — Main HTML file  
├── style.css             — Styles and layout  
├── script.js              — JavaScript logic  
├── assets/                — Images, icons, etc.  
├── README.md             — This documentation  
└── (any other modules)  

🛠️ Setup & Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Bankal-2708/Pokimon-card.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd Pokimon-card


Open index.html in your browser (you can also serve via a basic web server).

If you use build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.), run your server or build command accordingly.

🧩 Usage / How It Works

The app loads a set/array of image URLs (Pokimon card images).

It selects one (or more) images at random (or via some logic).

It injects HTML (with <img> tags and card containers) into a container element (e.g. #main).

You can add event listeners (hover, click) to change or cycle card images.

Example logic snippet:
let main = document.getElementById("main");
let cardImages = [
  "https://…/image1.jpg",
  "https://…/image2.jpg",
  // more URLs
];

let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * cardImages.length);
main.innerHTML = `<div class="card">
                    <img src="${cardImages[randomIndex]}" alt="Pokimon Card">
                  </div>`;

🔧 Future Improvements / To-Do

Add card metadata (name, type, stats) alongside images

Fetch card data from an API instead of hardcoded URLs

Animation effects (flip, hover, transitions)

Avoid repeated cards if showing multiple at once

Add error handling for failed image loads

Support filtering or searching cards

Improve styling and responsive design
